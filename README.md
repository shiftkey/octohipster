===========

This is a application to contrast how ReactiveUI works against another MVVM framework.

The `master` branch is the application, built with just MvvmLight. It's kinda hacky, because I was in rush. 
There's a bunch of dummy data inside the app, so it'll work offline.

The `reactive-ui` branch is the same application refactored to use ReactiveUI. There's many concepts in ReactiveUI 
which may be unfamiliar to developers, so rather than rewrite it I've been refactoring it gradually to show how to 
evolve an existing application to fit this pattern.
